	abstract  = { A group signature scheme in which signers are able to designate openers by specifying access structures over openers' attributes was introduced at CANDAR 2021, which is called GSdT. In this paper, we present a construction of GSdT from only symmetric-key primitives; pseudorandom functions, hash functions and commitments. Due to the features, our GSdT is expected to be secure against computational power of quantum computers. We first introduce syntax and security definitions in the static group model. Then, in our construction, the key ingredient is a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of knowledge system that is constructed from the primitives in the “MPC-in-the-head” paradigm, owing the technique that was developed by Katz, Kolesnikov and Wang (ACM-CCS 2018). Our approach starts with their group signature scheme, but non-trivially extends the Merkle tree so that signers can treat (all-AND) boolean formulas as the access structures. According to our estimation, the signing time is less than 3.0 sec and the signature size is less than 0.5 MB in a scenario that the numbers of group members and attributes are 27 and 23, respectively, and security to be attained is 128 bit quantum security. },

There exists only one aggregate signature which does not use the bilinear map, however, the scheme requires a non-standard cryptographic assumption in the security proof. In ProvSec 2020, Takemure et al. proposed a new variant of aggregate signatures, the aggregate signature with the pre-communication (ASwPC), to realize the security proof from a standard assumption. The ASwPC requires signers to interact with each other to share a temporary randomness before deciding their messages to be signed. After the pre-communication, each signer can start the signing process individually. They gave an instantiation of ASwPC based on the discrete logarithm (DL) assumption, and its security is proven in the random oracle and the knowledge of secret key (KOSK) model.},

	abstract = {From the birth of the blockchain technology, multisignatures attract much attention as a tool for handling blockchain transactions. Concerning the application to the blockchain, multisignatures with public-key aggregation, which can compress public keys of signers to a single public key, is preferable to the standard multisignature because the public keys and the signature used in a transaction are stored to verify the transaction later. Several multisignature schemes with public key aggregation are proposed, however, there are no known schemes having a tight security reduction.We propose a first multisignature with public-key aggregation whose security is proven to be tightly secure under the DDH assumption in the random oracle model. Our multisignature is based on the DDH-based multisignature by Le, Yang, and Ghorbani, however, our security proof is different from theirs. The idea of our security proof originates from another DDH-based multisignature by Le, Bonnecaze, and Gabillon whose security proof is tightly one. By tailoring their security proof to a setting which admits the public-key aggregation, we can prove the tight security of our multisignature.},

In this paper, we give a generic construction of multisignature schemes which is tightly secure in the PPK and random oracle model. Our construction can capture the known tightly secure multisignature schemes. The generic construction is derived from the identification (ID) scheme which has two properties called the linearity and the lossiness. Thus, we can obtain new tightly secure multisignature schemes by applying our construction to existing linear and lossy ID schemes. Moreover, we consider the relationship between these two properties to shrink the conditions required for our generic construction. We propose a new property of ID schemes, called the difference soundness, and show that the combination of the linearity and the difference soundness implies the lossiness.},

	abstract  = {Multisignatures enable multiple users to sign a message in an interactive manner. Many instantiations are proposed for multisignatures, however, most of them are quantum-insecure, because these are based on the integer factoring assumption or the discrete logarithm assumption. Although there exist some constructions based on the lattice problems, which are believed to be quantum-secure, their security reductions are loose. In this paper, we construct a first lattice-based multisignature which has a tight security reduction. Our basic strategy is combining the multisignature scheme proposed by El Bansarkhani and Sturm with the lattice-based standard signature scheme by Abdalla, Fouque, Lyubashevsky and Tibouchi which has a tight security reduction from the Ring-LWE (Ring Learning with Error) assumption.},

In the random oracle model (ROM), it is provable from the DL assumption, whereas there is a negative circumstantial evidence in the standard model. Fleischhacker, Jager and Schr{\"o}der showed that the tight security of the Schnorr signature is unprovable from a strong cryptographic assumption, such as the One-more DL (OM-DL) assumption and the computational and decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption, in the ROM via a generic reduction as long as the underlying cryptographic assumption holds. However, it remains open whether or not the impossibility of the provable security of the Schnorr signature from a strong assumption via a non-tight and reasonable reduction. In this paper, we show that the security of the Schnorr signature is unprovable from the OM-DL assumption in the non-programmable ROM as long as the OM-DL assumption holds. Our impossibility result is proven via a non-tight and non-restricted Turing reduction.},

In ISC 2015, Fukumitsu and Hasegawa found another conditions to prove such an impossibility, however their result requires a strong condition on a reduction, i.e. a key-preserving reduction. In this paper, we focus on a non-key-preserving reduction, and then we show that an FS-type signature cannot be proven to be secure in the NPROM via a sequentially multi-instance reduction from the security of the underlying ID scheme. Our result can be interpreted as a generalization of the two impossibility results introduced above.},
